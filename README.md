## Setup Instructions

1. Update the value of `application` in `appengine-web.xml` to the app
   ID you have registered in the App Engine admin console and would
   like to use to host your instance of this sample.


1. Run the application with `mvn appengine:devserver`, and ensure it's
   running by visiting your local server's api explorer's address (by
   default [localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer][5].)

1. Get the client library with

   $ mvnappengine:endpoints_get_client_lib

   It will generate a client library jar file under the
   `target/endpoints-client-libs/<api-name>/target` directory of your
   project, as well as install the artifact into your local maven
   repository.

1. Deploy your application to Google App Engine with

   $ mvn appengine:update
